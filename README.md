# PROJECTS FOR PYTHON3 PROGRAMMING COURSE ON COURSERA

## PR0JECT 1: sentiments.py
We have provided some synthetic (fake, semi-randomly generated) twitter data in a csv file named project_twitter_data.csv which has the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. We have also words that express positive sentiment and negative sentiment, in the files positive_words.txt and negative_words.txt.

Your task is to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. You will create a csv file, which contains columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score for each tweet. At the end, you upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets, and produce a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets.
### STEP 1
To start, define a function called strip_punctuation which takes one parameter, a string which represents a word, and removes characters considered punctuation from everywhere in the word. (Hint: remember the .replace() method for strings.)

### STEP 2
Next, copy in your strip_punctuation function and define a function called get_pos which takes one parameter, a string which represents one or more sentences, and calculates how many words in the string are considered positive words. Use the list, positive_words to determine what words will count as positive. The function should return a positive integer - how many occurrences there are of positive words in the text. Note that all of the words in positive_words are lower cased, so you’ll need to convert all the words in the input string to lower case as well.

### STEP 3
Next, copy in your strip_punctuation function and define a function called get_neg which takes one parameter, a string which represents one or more sentences, and calculates how many words in the string are considered negative words. Use the list, negative_words to determine what words will count as negative. The function should return a positive integer - how many occurrences there are of negative words in the text. Note that all of the words in negative_words are lower cased, so you’ll need to convert all the words in the input string to lower case as well.

### STEP 4
Finally, copy in your previous functions and write code that opens the file project_twitter_data.csv which has the fake generated twitter data (the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet). Your task is to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative each tweet is. Copy the code from the code windows above, and put that in the top of this code window. Now, you will write code to create a csv file called resulting_data.csv, which contains the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score (how positive or negative the text is overall) for each tweet. The file should have those headers in that order. Remember that there is another component to this project. You will upload the csv file to Excel or Google Sheets and produce a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets.

## PROJECT 2: movie-rating.py
This project will take you through the process of mashing up data from two different APIs to make movie recommendations. The TasteDive API lets you provide a movie (or bands, TV shows, etc.) as a query input, and returns a set of related items. The OMDB API lets you provide a movie title as a query input and get back data about the movie, including scores from various review sites (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, etc.).

You will put those two together. You will use TasteDive to get related movies for a whole list of titles. You’ll combine the resulting lists of related movies, and sort them according to their Rotten Tomatoes scores (which will require making API calls to the OMDB API.)

To avoid problems with rate limits and site accessibility, we have provided a cache file with results for all the queries you need to make to both OMDB and TasteDive. Just use requests_with_caching.get() rather than requests.get(). If you’re having trouble, you may not be formatting your queries properly, or you may not be asking for data that exists in our cache. We will try to provide as much information as we can to help guide you to form queries for which data exists in the cache.
### STEP 1
Your first task will be to fetch data from TasteDive. The documentation for the API is at https://tastedive.com/read/api.

Define a function, called get_movies_from_tastedive. It should take one input parameter, a string that is the name of a movie or music artist. The function should return the 5 TasteDive results that are associated with that string; be sure to only get movies, not other kinds of media. It will be a python dictionary with just one key, ‘Similar’.

Try invoking your function with the input “Black Panther”.

HINT: Be sure to include only q, type, and limit as parameters in order to extract data from the cache. If any other parameters are included, then the function will not be able to recognize the data that you’re attempting to pull from the cache. Remember, you will not need an api key in order to complete the project, because all data will be found in the cache.
### STEP 2
Please copy the completed function from above into this active code window. Next, you will need to write a function that extracts just the list of movie titles from a dictionary returned by get_movies_from_tastedive. Call it extract_movie_titles.
### STEP 3
Please copy the completed functions from the two code windows above into this active code window. Next, you’ll write a function, called get_related_titles. It takes a list of movie titles as input. It gets five related movies for each from TasteDive, extracts the titles for all of them, and combines them all into a single list. Don’t include the same movie twice.
### STEP 4
Your next task will be to fetch data from OMDB. The documentation for the API is at https://www.omdbapi.com/

Define a function called get_movie_data. It takes in one parameter which is a string that should represent the title of a movie you want to search. The function should return a dictionary with information about that movie.

Again, use requests_with_caching.get(). For the queries on movies that are already in the cache, you won’t need an api key. You will need to provide the following keys: t and r. As with the TasteDive cache, be sure to only include those two parameters in order to extract existing data from the cache.
### STEP 5
Please copy the completed function from above into this active code window. Now write a function called get_movie_rating. It takes an OMDB dictionary result for one movie and extracts the Rotten Tomatoes rating as an integer. For example, if given the OMDB dictionary for “Black Panther”, it would return 97. If there is no Rotten Tomatoes rating, return 0.
### STEP 6
Now, you’ll put it all together. Don’t forget to copy all of the functions that you have previously defined into this code window. Define a function get_sorted_recommendations. It takes a list of movie titles as an input. It returns a sorted list of related movie titles as output, up to five related movies for each input movie title. The movies should be sorted in descending order by their Rotten Tomatoes rating, as returned by the get_movie_rating function. Break ties in reverse alphabetic order, so that ‘Yahşi Batı’ comes before ‘Eyyvah Eyvah’.# python-3-programming
